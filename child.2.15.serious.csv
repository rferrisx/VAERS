He got the Pfizer vaccine, seconds after getting in his left arm, mom noted that he looked very """"wide eyed"""" and distraught.  She notes that he slumped forward and had lost consciousness for approximately 5 seconds.  She noticed shaking movements in his right arm and bilateral lower legs.  She notes that his left arm was against her and therefore cannot comment on it.  She notes that his eyes were closed.  No tongue biting and no incontinence.  No secondary trauma.  She notes that when these 5 seconds were over he then had a period for about 30 minutes where he looked pale and was breathing heavy but was alert and answering questions.  She notes that he has had presyncopal episodes and episodes of feeling faint when getting flu shots in the past.  However, this time she noted that he had shaking which made her nervous for possible seizure activity.  Patient denies any chest pain or headache prior to the symptoms.  She came via ambulance for further evaluation.   On arrival, he reports that he feels 90% back to his baseline.  He notes that he does not feel quite ready to run around yet however denies any pains or discomforts, headache, weakness, numbness, or tingling.

On arrival, he was alert, well-appearing, in no acute distress.  His vital signs were normal for age on room air.  His physical exam was very reassuring as above with a normal neurologic and cardiac evaluation.   Differential includes vasovagal/syncope in the setting of a known stressful trigger vs seizure given report of shaking in his extremities.  We feel the latter is significantly less likely given the timeline of the events.  Has no known seizure activity nor any triggers per history (fever, trauma, etc.).  He also has a normal neurologic assessment. At this time we will defer neurology consults given low concern for seizure.  It is possible that this represents a side effect of the vaccine however we also feel that this is less likely given the fact that his symptoms have been seconds after receiving the vaccine.  Nonetheless we reported the symptoms to the pharmacist who recorded it in the database.  We attained an EKG showing a known incomplete right bundle branch block (unchanged from 2013) and a slightly prolonged QTC of 477 (previously 451).    I encourage patient to stay well-hydrated, well rested in the setting of his suspected syncopal episode this morning.  I also suggested that for further vaccinations, that he lay down on the table and drink/eat well prior.  We provided strict return to ED criteria in the setting of worsening symptoms. All questions were answered at the time of discharge. Mom verbalized her understanding and agreement of the plan.

That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring>quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.

A 13-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0164, expiration date: 31Aug2021), at the age of 13 years old, in left arm on 14May2021 16:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient was a normal 13 years old, he doesn't take anything, he's active. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. The vaccines administered on same date with BNT162B2 was none. The previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient previously received the flu shot every year and experienced no adverse event. On 16May2021, about 48 hours after the vaccination, the patient started having stomach pain in the middle of the night. It began 16May2021 in the evening and into 17May2021, the patient was having stomach pain and not feeling well. Reporter stated the patient woke her up. Reporter stated they thought it was some food he ate. Reporter stated they tested his covid antibodies and they also personally at home on 17May2021 night, they tested him with a home kit for covid just to double check because nobody really brought it up and it was negative also. Reporter confirmed the home covid test was done on 17May2021. Reporter stated there was no known exposure, they just did it to make sure he didn't have covid. The patient was taken to the emergency room on 18May2021. Reporter stated they were waiting because patient felt good during the day and they thought nothing was wrong, but then the extreme stomach pain started again and so on 18May2021, she took him to the local emergency room. Reporter stated they didn't do much other than push on his stomach, she was worried about appendicitis. Reporter stated they didn't worry too much, but she thought maybe it was his appendix. The doctor examined him and said he had a stomach issue and released him with medicine and that was the 18May2021. On 19May2021 and 20May2021, the patient would get intermittent stomach pain, again thinking it was a stomach bug or something. On 20May2021, the patient experienced petechial rash on his legs. Reporter called the pediatrician and again the patient was having intermittent stomach pain and kept having it intermittently. The patient would feel fine then feel sick again then on the 22May2021, the patient had more bad stomach pain and some vomiting so he wound up back in the emergency department, it was a different one than the first on 22May2021. The patient did a lot of blood work, his labs came back good, but he did not do a CAT scan, but reporter tried to do everything else, tested patient for covid, antibodies and everything and they sent him home again on the 22May2021. The patient had intermittent pain again throughout 23May2021 then on 24May2021, he went to visit the pediatrician just for a visit and they were thinking its Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) which is an autoimmune response and they still didn't have a diagnosis for his stomach. Reporter stated patient was perfectly fine at the pediatrician, then when they got home, he started having lower left abdominal pain and he doubled over in pain and started vomiting. The patient vomited about three times in total, it wasn't like excessive vomiting. Reporter stated the pain would bring it on, he does have a rash, which is still getting a little bit worse. Reporter stated they took him back to the emergency room, they did a CAT scan and that showed he had inflammation in his intestines and his stomach so they kept him in the hospital. The patient was admitted on 24May2021 when he visited the emergency room for the third time. Reporter stated because patient was in pain, they admitted him to watch him. Reporter stated they were worried about the patient having intussusception with the bowel, where his bowel can go inside each other and can create a blockage, so they wanted to admit him to make sure that didn't happen. Reporter stated the worst of the stomach pain was on 25May2021, which would have been at 19:00. The patient had not had an episode since then, he hadn't had an attack like that since. The whole week before from 17May2021, or the 16May2021 when it started through 25May2021, it was very intermittent of a lot of pain. So far, knock on wood, the patient hadn't had it since 25May2021 at 19:00 and hopefully tonight it won't happen. Reporter stated it will be about 48 hours of not having the bad pain. Reporter stated he still has some pain, but not like where she had to rush him to the emergency room. The patient's vomiting ended on 24May2021 or 25May2021. He had recovered completely from vomiting so far. The patient was released on 26May2021 with a diagnosis of HSP, which was an auto immune response, and he'd never had this happen before. Reporter stated if she googled HSP, it said it can still get worse, but it was not the worst case of HSP. Reporter stated the patient has never had anything like this before, he was perfectly fine, they made it through covid and didn't get covid and he is a healthy kid so she thought Pfizer should know. The outcome of the events HSP, stomach pain, petechial rash was not recovered. The outcome of vomiting was recovered on 24May2021 or 25May2021.

That day he presented to an outside hospital emergency department where he was found to have elevated troponin and EKG with ST segment elevation.  He was then transferred to the hospital pediatric ICU for further care.  On admission to the PICU treatment was started with IV Toradol.  Echocardiogram was performed and revealed mildly decreased left ventricular systolic function.  His peak troponin level was 27.43.  He remains hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the pediatric floor.  By 6/14/2021 his chest pain had resolved and he continued to improve with NSAID therapy alone.  His troponin down trended to 2.62 on day of discharge.  Repeat echo on day of discharge showed improving but still mildly diminished systolic function.  Repeat ECG at discharge showed persistent ST elevation. He was discharged with a prescription to continue ibuprofen 600 mg 3 times daily and follow-up with pediatric cardiology in 1 to 2 weeks.,"Troponin: 27.43 ng/mL (6/13), 11.18 ng/mL (6/14), 2.62 ng/mL (6/15) CRP: 6.24 (6/13) Echocardiogram: 6/13/21: Summary:  1.

Went to ER who initially obtained CBC with stable Hgb and sent home with Zofran. Patient continued to have bloody emesis so presented back to ER where they did CXR which was normal, gave IVF bolus, zofran, repeat CBC with Hgb 12.4 and transferred to another hospital for higher level of care.  At the hospital, Initially made NPO and placed on IV fluids in preparation for possible endoscopy. Repeat labs showed stable hemoglobin compared to outside hospital. GI consulted and determined that hematemesis was most likely due to Mallory Weiss tear. Recommended carafate before meals, chloraseptic spray as needed for sore throat, continuing IV Protonix and IV zofran as needed, and gradually advancing her diet. On HD#3, she had another episode of hematemesis after eating solids. Overnight, tolerated liquids and solids without any further episodes of emesis. Tolerated transition from IV to PO meds and maintained hydration off of IV fluids. Due to symptom improvement, GI did not recommend endoscopy at this time and recommended that she be discharged on 1 week course of carafate, 2 month course of omperazole, and zofran as needed with plans for GI follow-up in 1-2 months. Had another episode of hematemesis at home after discharge. Went back to hospital and admitted again. The patient underwent upper endoscopy which showed no source of upper GI bleed. ENT was consulted and performed a nasopharyngolaryngoscopy which was negative for an ENT source of bleeding. She remained stable without an identifiable source of bleeding.

REASON FOR ADMISSION: Patient is a 13-year-old previously healthy male who was admitted after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with ROSC after CPR for 15 minutes in the field, found to be in the context of large cerebellar hemorrhage secondary to brain lesion (AVM vs tumor).   BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITALIZATION: Patient was intubated prior to arrival to the ED. Upon arrival he was started on epinephrine and norepinephrine drips to maintain perfusion and was administered bicarbonate x2. Head CTA was obtained and was notable for midbrain hemorrhage and tonsillar herniation, and no contrast enhanced blood flow in the brain.   Brain death exams were completed at 09:59 and 14:20. APNEA test was performed at 13:30, which is the official time of brain death.  Official cause of death was brainstem herniation from intracranial hemorrhage.    Mechanical ventilation was continued to allow family time to grieve and perform last rites. Time of cardiac death after mechanical ventilation withdrawal was 18:36.     HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:   FEN/Renal/Endo:  #Central DI He received 1.5 L of normal saline bolus in the ED and an additional 3 L of ringers lactate bolus overnight in the ICU to maintain perfusion and decrease heart rate.  His sodium was 141 upon presentation but reached a maximum of 160 due to central diabetes insipidus. He was started on 0.45% normal saline at 100 mL/hr to improve hypernatremia, which was monitored Q1h until normonatremic.  He additionally required vasopressin drip to be started due to central DI, which was increased to a maximum of 20 mU/kg/hr.    CV: At time of admission, epinephrine was running at 0.1 mcg/kg/min and norepinephrine was 0.1 mcg/kg/hr. Norepinephrine was increased shortly thereafter to 0.12 mcg/kg/min.   In the morning after admission, he had tachycardia to the 190s, which appeared to be narrow complex. Epinephrine and norepinephrine were discontinued. Two doses of adenosine were administered (6 mg first dose, 12 mg second dose) due to suspected SVT. The rate decreased for ~4 seconds after the second dose however returned to ~180. EKG arrived which showed sinus tachycardia so no further medications or cardiac interventions were done.  Fluid rates were increased to 2x MIVF rate and additional 500 mL bolus of LR was administered.   Norepinephrine and epinephrine were restarted and escalated due to low blood pressures in the early afternoon.to allow family time with patient.  Both titrated to effect.   Pulm: Patient was mechanically ventilated to achieve normal pH, normocarbia, and high arterial oxygen tension per brain death protocol.  He had no primary pulmonary disease during this admission.   Neuro:  #Intraparenchymal hemorrhage #Tonsillar herniation Neurosurgery was consulted. Mannitol x1 and hypertonic saline 23% x1 were administered to decrease intracranial pressures. Keppra 2g was administered for seizure prophylaxis. No sedation was needed during patient's hospitalization.

She was then transferred to another hospital for further care .    Upon arrival here she notes improvement in her energy level and all of her pain except for her chest pain.  She describes it as a pressure on top of her chest that is right in the center and is worse with movement and deep breaths.   Of note she had a appendectomy a few years ago that was complicated by surgeons making the bowel and then required her to have a bowel resection.

Briefly, patient is presenting with chest pain, myalgias, and fever in setting of recent covid vaccine (2nd dose Pfizer 2 days ago).  Seen at an outside hospital where labs were notable for mildly elevated BNP and D-dimer, negative troponin, normal LFTs and chemistries.  Chest x-ray reportedly negative.  EKG with T wave inversions in V1 through V4 (read as nonspecific ST changes by their physician), but otherwise normal.  Given the possibility of post Covid vaccine myocarditis or PE, transferred for further management.  Patient states that after Toradol that she received the outside hospital all of her other symptoms have resolved but she continues to have chest pain.     My exam showed: Gen: tired but nontoxic appearing, no acute distress, alert and active; HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, normal conjunctiva, neck supple without LAN; Chest: significant reproducible chest pain; Card: RRR, no murmur, good perfusion, brisk radial pulses bilaterally; Lungs: CTAB, good air entry, no increased WOB; Abd: soft, non-tender, non-distended, no masses; Ext: warm and well perfused, moving all extremities; Skin: no rashes     Chest pain. Overall well appearing with normal exam with reproducible tenderness.  Given recent Covid vaccine, must consider myocarditis, although only mildly elevated BNP and negative troponin at the outside hospital are reassuring, especially given reproducible pain and reassuring EKG.  Symptoms then may represent musculoskeletal etiology such as costochondritis or myositis related to vaccination.  Less likely pneumonia or pneumothorax, but possible.  Low suspicion for PE given lack of persistent tachycardia (tachycardia improved while in ED, currently HR 80s) or hypoxia. EKG obtained which showed T wave inversions in V1-V4 (normal for age).  Bedside ultrasound with normal global function and lack of pericardial effusion.  Labs obtained in BCH ED notable for negative BNP and troponin, along with reassuring lipase given abdominal pain.  Thus, unlikely to be true myocarditis, more likely musculoskeletal etiology such as costochondritis or chest wall pain.  Cardiology will discuss with mom for reassurance.  Final Diagnosis  1.

PATIENT SUMMARY:  Reason for Hospitalization: Chest discomfort, myocarditis.    Admission HPI: a 13 year old boy with a history of hypertension and mild intermittent asthma who is presenting with several hours of shortness of breath and chest discomfort with deep breaths.   2 days ago prior to presentation, he developed a low grade fever that lasted for 1 day. He did not measure a temperature but took some Motrin. At the same time he was experiencing abdominal pain and diarrhea, the latter of which has persisted. He does not think the diarrhea has been bloody but is unable to describe the color or consistency. The day of presentation, he began experiencing mid-sternal chest discomfort that sometimes worsened with deep breaths, though not every deep breath. It was associated with a mild headache. He denies palpitations, light headedness, orthopnea, or syncope. No other symptoms of illness including cough, congestion, runny nose, itchy eyes, rash, wheezing, or emesis. No known sick contacts. Given the nature of his chest pain, he presented to the ED for further evaluation.  Of note, he received his 2nd Pfizer Covid vaccine on July 7. He experienced some mild arm discomfort afterwards but no fevers/myalgias/chest pain in the following days.   In the ED, he was well appearing with normal vital signs. He denied any active chest pain or shortness of breath, though continued to endorse mild abdominal discomfort. An EKG was performed which was notable for diffusely elevated ST segments, particularly in leads II and III.  Labs are significant for elevated troponin to 0.13, d-dimer to 1.05, ESR of 76, CRP of 9.35, WBC 9, Hgb 11.9, and negative covid antibodies. CXR was benign. Decision was made to admit to Cardiology for close monitoring and further workup.  PMH: significant for elevated blood pressures in the past, seen in Nephrology clinic in 2019 with unremarkable workup including renal ultrasound, blood and urine studies. Believed to be in large part attributed to anxiety, though does have a family history of ESRD.  Surg: T&A at 4-5 years of age  Allergies: NKA  Meds: only PRN albuterol (last used 1 year ago)  Fam history: + for ESRD, negative for cardiac or autoimmune diseases  Social: everyone at home healthy, nobody has had COVID. Going into 8th grade, wants to learn about space  Hospital Course: He was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. His chest pain resolved shortly after admission and he remained asymptomatic through admission. The morning after his admission, his troponin was stable at 0.12 and echocardiogram showed no abnormalities with normal function. Troponins were trended and remained stable. Inflammatory markers were trended and improved. Cardiac MRI performed prior to treatment showed a small area over the posterior LV free wall of late gadolinium enhancement. EKG showed stable ST elevation in inferior and lateral leads. Presentation was most consistent with viral myocarditis.  Given increasing troponin, he was treated with IVIG (2g/kgx1) and steroids (5 day total). His inflammatory markers down trended and resolution of symptoms throughout admission (ESR falsely elevated after IVIG), and had improvement in his troponin after treatment with IVIG and steroids. EKG were stable during admission.  By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Chest pain was fully resolved. Follow up with cardiology in place. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Given history of elevated blood pressures, also demonstrated during admission here, and evaluation by nephrology in past, he was set up with nephrology follow up as an outpatient.

Diagnosis List  1. Shortness of breath, 07/20/2021 2. Myocarditis, 07/20/2021  Patient Instructions  He was admitted for management of myocarditis thought to be due to a virus. He had multiple EKGs, echocardiograms, and a cardiac MRI which showed mild changes but overall good heart function. His chest pain and heart studies improved throughout his stay and he was safe for discharge home.   He should take the following medications when going home:  - Prednisolone 30 mg twice per day, with last dose on 7/26 in the morning  - Famotidine 20mg twice per day, while taking steroids.  It is important for him to minimize activity that raises his heart rate for the next 3 months. This will be discussed in more detail at his cardiology appointment. Until then, no strenuous exercise.   8/5/2021 clinic follow up: Cardiology Diagnostics     EKG: WNL  Echo: Normal function LV short-axis % area change 50.2 % -0.9 54.4 44.9 63.9  LV ejection fraction (area-length) 57.1 % -1.4 63.0 55.0 72.0   Labs noted in right hand column. CRP still elevated (higher than at discharge).      Assessment/Plan  Since his discharge, he has had headaches every almost every day. He thinks this is improving slowly but he has had about 2-3 headaches a day. He has had Tylenol and Motrin and this helps. He describes the pain as 4-5 /10 on the pain scale. He has not had any chest pain, no dizziness, no palpitations, no syncope. His mother says he is crankier than usual and she is concerned about his headache.

They were purplish/red blister-like almost looked like blood blisters but very painful to the touch. Mother took her to urgent care where the provider was unsure what they were.  She did not believe they were STDs so instead tested her for Covid19 virus and told her to use Vaseline on them.  Mother and child went home around 2:00am on 31 Aug 2021.  31 Aug 2021 (12:00 pm) - Mother took child to ER.  The pain had increased greatly, and the child was having difficulty urinating without burning or pain. Although the child was NOT sexually active and had never had any sexual interactions, the doctor said he could not rule out an STD.  He conducted a vaginal exam, urinalysis, and drew bloodwork for STD and CBC.  CBC was normal, urinalysis showed 3-5 white blood cells without significant bacteria.  Conducted SBC and Bacteria wet prep indicating few-moderate result, likely due to the use of Vaseline as instructed by the urgent care.  Negative for clue cells yeast, negative for trichomonas.  Doctor prescribed Metrogel 0.75% and sent patient home to await results of the STD testing. STD testing included Chlamydia Trachomatis, Neisseria Gonorrhoeae, Herpes Simplex Virus Culture 1 & 2.  [NOTE: within days, these tests results would ALL return negative results as expected for a non-sexually active child].   1 Sep 2021 (9am):  Mother took child to another ER.  The child was in extreme pain, could barely walk or sit comfortably.  Child was unable to urinate without crying and extreme pain.  Child refused to urinate unless absolutely necessary.  Results from the Chlamydia Trachomatis and Neisseria Gonorrhoeae tests had returned negative but the herpes had not yet returned.  Upon examination, the doctors diagnosed her with Lipschutz ulcers stating that they did not know the cause but that it is rarely present and usually presents when a non-sexually active adolescent has had certain viruses.  The doctors told her to STOP using the Metrogel, there was no bacteria present to be treated.  Doctors prescribed her with multiple medications to include clobetasoL 0.05% ointment, lidocaine 5% ointment, Oxycodone 5mg immediate release tablets (take 2.5mg at a time).  They also conducted a urinalysis and found that she also now had a UTI prescribing her Cephalexin capsules. Child was sent home and told to follow-up with a gynecologists'.    2 Sep 2021 (3pm):  Mother took child to see gynecologists'.  Gynecologist confirmed the diagnosis stating that it is very uncommon.  She prescribed her with an oral steroid to take if the steroid cream did not improve the issues within 48 hours. Told her not to use Vaseline as this could cause bacterial infections.  scheduled a follow-up visit for 8 Sep 2021.   4 Sep 2021: Child began oral steroids because the ulcers had not improved.  UTI pain had decreased by this time.   6 Sep 2021: Child's ulcers had improved and pain had decreased.  No longer taking any pain medication, but still using the lidocaine and steroid creams.

Over the course of this time, the ulcers had reduced in size and pain became less and less.   8 Sep: Follow-up with gynecologist.  Ulcers were now almost completely gone, pain had subsided.  Doctor ordered the following blood tests: Epstein-Barr Virus Antibody Panel 1, Cytomegalovirus Antibody, IGG Avidity, and CMV Antibody, IGM.  At this visit, the doctor told us her Herpes Simplex 1 & 2 test results were also negative. She stated that if these other 3 blood tests were negative, the only diagnosis for the Lipschutz ulcers would likely be a reaction to receiving the Covid19 vaccine.    17 Sep 2021: Gynecologist notified parent that all blood tests conducted for Epstein-Barr Virus Antibody Panel 1, Cytomegalovirus Antibody, IGG Avidity, and CMV Antibody, IGM all returned NEGATIVE results.

He describes a sharp pain that is worse with breathing occurring over a moderate-sized region of the mid-upper left anterior chest without radiation. The last episode occurred on 17Jun2021 when he was walking and running outside playing a """"water gun"""" game with friends. He ran about 10 minutes and developed chest pain for several minutes that then lasted for a total of an hour. He felt a Slight increase in heart rate with the chest pain. He has no history of chest pain prior to the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. His asthma episodes are triggered by upper respiratory tract infections. He has had no lightheadedness, syncope, dyspnea or exercise intolerance.  The recent records were reviewed, Including the discharge summary, electrocardiograms, labs, heart MRI report, and echocardiogram reports. The electrocardiograms used T wave abnormalities and elevated troponin, but a structurally and functionally normal heart by echocardiogram and heart MRI. Diaqnosis of, post, Covid Vaccine myocarditis was made.  An echocardiogram was performedto assess heart function due to the post vaccine myocarditis. It demonstrated:  Normal intra-cardiac and aortic arch anatomy.  Physiologic tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency.  Normal cardiac dimensions and biventricular function, including normal tissue Doppler  NO pericardial effusion.  The patient who was previously healthy, developed chest pain with electrocardiographic abnormalities and elevated troponin after his second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, consistent with post-Covid vaccine myocarditis. He has had 1 other episode of chest pain since discharge from the hospital. I recommended restricting from significant physical activity or competitive sports, pending a repeat troponin level. At the time of this writing (30Jun2021 at 11 PM), I have not received a copy of the troponin level. If the troponin level is normal or significantly trending down, I would refer him for a cardiopulmonary exercise test in the near future prior to allowing return to normal physical activities.

The evening of 05Jun2021, the patient had fever, chills, body shake, headache, coughing, sore throat, and fatigue which all lasted longer than after the first dose.

The patient has had blood work, every test. 80 tubes of blood has taken on the patient over the course of this time. The lab work showed that the patient's inflammation markers are elevated. The patient's C reactive protein was 2.1. The doctors are trying to figure out what is going on that doesn't fit into a category of anything particular. The patient's sedimentary rate is running high, her white blood cell count is high, CB19 cells are high, CD8T cells are high. Investigations: The patient's inflammatory markers have been elevated- platelets, C reactive proteins, sedimentary rate, RDW and everything that shows extreme inflammation has been elevated the whole time.

The rash was from the patient's neck and everywhere. The patient is not currently on any medications.  The immune mediated reaction is going on through the patient's body. The patient had a biopsy of the lymph nodes because they were afraid it was cancer. The biopsy showed CD4 and CD8 immunoglobulins had double negative receptors and the doctors were concerned about a particular HELPS but the patient was negative. Those markers are supposed to be about 10% and the patient's was at 6 % so they were checking that for awhile but it was negative. The patient's biopsy was negative for infection and cancer. Since this started, the patient has had a low grade but big immunological reaction. When all of this happened they were in and out of the pediatrician's office.

Due to the patient's ill appearance, nurse went to get a BP cuff and alerted physician of the situation as she was getting one. Physician arrived in the bathroom. Nurse took BP- 110/72 at this time. Physician did a physical exam of patient and instructed nurse to have patient lie down with feet elevated and monitor her. Nurse took patient back to the exam room, laid her in supine position, elevated feet with a pillow, and left the room for approximately another 4-5 minutes.   Mother again alerted nurse that pulse oximeter machine was beeping, and nurse returned to room. Patient was still complaining of nausea and appeared very pale. Patients pulse was in the 50s and low 60s, and her pulse ox was holding stead at 97-99% range. Nurse took a manual heart rate with stethoscope to verify accuracy of pulse oximeter machine- 60bpm. Nurse took BP again- 92/62. Nurse alerted physician.  Physician came to exam room, examined patient. Patient was still complaining of severe nausea. Patient was still extremely pale. Physician BP- 98/58. HR still in 50s and 60s.  Decision was made by physician to give 0.3mg of epinephrine to patient and call 911. Nurse alerted front office staff to call 911. Nurse drew up 0.3mg of epi, dose was verified by physician and second nurse. Nurse administered 0.3mg of epi to patient at 2:49pm.  Ambulance arrived approximately 5 minutes later.  Ambulance team took over monitoring patient vitals. Ambulance team advised mom that if she went to the hospital she would just have to wait and then be sent home. Mom requested to speak with physician, who advised mom that patient needed to go to the hospital for monitoring. After physician left the room, ambulance team member told mom that she had worked at the hospital, and she knew that the care patient would receive at the hospital would not be different than the care elsewhere. Nurse communicated with mom that physician recommended patient be taken via ambulance to be seen at the hospital as she had a serious allergic reaction to the COVID vaccine, and she needs to be under observation.  Discussed option to be monitored at hospitals' urgent care versus ER to save on cost.  Mom was concerned about the cost of an expensive ambulance ride, and she ultimately opted to drive to an alternate hospital (across the street from the office) against the advice of the physician and nurse.  Nurse advised mom that she needed to drive immediately to the alternate hospital. Instructed mom that if patient deteriorated in the car to call 911 immediately. Mom agreed.  At the time of patient leaving, she was still complaining of nausea. She was no complaining of headache as well. Color had improved. Blood pressure was up, 110s over 70s. Heart rate was still in 60s.   Immediately after patient left nurse notified physician of mom's decision to drive to alternate hospital. Note: Epinephrine Lot #: 27670 Epinephrine Expiration Date: 09/2022 Administered in left vastus lateralis muscle  - Nurse  --- Agree with above.  Initially, felt reaction was likely vasovagal response to vaccine (although had not occurred for her with prior vaccines/bloodwork).  No wheezing, difficulty breathing, cough, or rash.  Timing seemed prolonged for a vasovagal event and was worsening over 30 minutes of monitoring.  Due decreasing BP, decreasing HR (although lower than her norm based on prior vitals- not tachycardic), poor perfusion, pallor, headache, and persistent nausea- even after laying down with feet elevated, drinking water, resting, and monitoring, decided to give epi for possible allergic reaction and send to the ER for monitoring.  Per mom, patient was monitored at a hospital.  ER doctor felt most likely a vasovagal response rather than anaphylactic reaction.  She is doing better.

Higher level of depakote was attributed to increased bioavailability of IV medication.

He does have what appears to be an erupting mandibular right molar. However, otherwise, I cannot fully explain his facial pain today. I discussed with pharmacy and together we have not heard of this is a side effect of the Pfizer vaccine though we will certainly write it up and send it and should this become a problem with this very new therapy. I do not think he needs emergent imaging now given that his pain is nearly completely resolved and his neurological exam is normal.  We talked about warning signs such as tingling weakness facial droop as signs to come back emergently for further work-up. They will also come back if his pain gets more severe. However, given such rapid decline in his pain I think that we can observe watchful waiting with return should symptoms worsen or change. Final Diagnosis: 1. Facial pain R51.9.",None,None

Procedure in Detail: After informed consent was obtained the patient was transported to the OR. A timeout was performed and perioperative antibiotics were given. The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.   A 12mm port was inserted in the umbilical position under direct visualization and the abdomen was insufflated. A 5mm 30 degree laparoscope was introduced. Two additional ports were inserted, one in the suprapubic position and one in the left lower quadrant, under direct laparoscopic visualization without incident. There were numerous dilated small bowel loops with distally decompressed bowel loops as well as serous fluid throughout the peritoneal cavity, likely a reaction to the distal small bowel obstruction. The appendix was tucked under the distal ileal mesentery, where it had perforated, and upon mobilizing the distal ile um and its mesentery an abscess cavity was released, draining purulent fluid which was suctioned out. The appendix had a blown-out hole in its mid-body. The appendix was exposed and retracted anteriorly and inferiorly, splaying open the appendiceal mesentery. A window was made in the appendiceal mesentery with the Maryland ligasure cautery and then the appendiceal mesentery was then taken with the ligasure cautery. The base of the appendix was transected with an endoGIA stapler. The appendix was removed via the umbilical port site using a specimen retrieval bag and then the peritoneal cavity was suctioned out. The small bowel was run proximally starting at the terminal ileum, and some loose fibrinous adhesions from the small intestine to the proximal rectum/distal sigmoid were released bluntly. The transition point of the obstruction was positively identified and easily released. We ran the bowel proximally for several more feet, and there were no other points of obstruction. The bowel was still fairly dilated but was all viable.   Once this was completed the surgical bed was inspected and the staple line was noted to be intact and the hemostasis was adequate. A rectus sheath block was performed using 0.2% plain ropivacaine under laparoscopic visualization. The ports were removed under direct visualization and the abdomen was desufflated. The incisions were closed in layers with absorbable sutures, cleaned and dried, and sterile dressings were applied.","Ultrasound with finding of appendicitis on 12/13 CT scan with finding of possible perforated appendix and obstruction of bowl 12/13 laprascopic surgery on 12/13 2:00pm confirming appendix blown out and obstruction.

S/p coiling of aneurysm, bilateral EVD placement and R decompressive craniectomy. She has acute respiratory failure, strep viridans bacteremia, and concurrent COVID-19 infection.  Presented 12/2/21 with aneurysm and incidentally found to be COVID positive.   NEURO: On arrival, she was somewhat responsive and by the time she arrived at ED she was posturing versus seizing. Head CT revealed hemorrhage 3x3x3 hemorrhagic focus anterior and inferior to the right basal ganglion with mass effect, also with intraventricular blood in lateral and third ventricles with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in suprasellar cistern and bilateral sylvian fissures. At that time, reportedly pupils equal, 3-4, minimally reactive. At ED, received Mannitol bolus, and 4mg Ativan administered. Flight for Life activated and upon arrival to CW was admitted to the PICU with plan for emergent EVD placement. Neurosurgery placed EVD at bedside. Repeat head CT and CTA performed and demonstrated bilobed aneurysm arising from right ICA terminus with enlarging intraparenchymal hematoma along superior aspect mostly likely representing a ruptured aneurysm, increased intraventricular hemorrhage, similar subarachnoid hemorrhage, increased mass effect, effacement of basal cisterns, worsened midline shift. Optimized neuroprotection management with sedation, neuromuscular blockade, ventilator management, and hypertonic saline. R pupil became dilated and nonreactive and patient demonstrated persistently elevated ICPs >50. She underwent emergent IR coiling and R decompressive craniectomy with second right-sided EVD placement. Patient continued to demonstrate ICPs in 20s. Worked with Neurosurgery to optimize sedation. Repeat head CT demonstrated increased hypoattenuation in right frontal and parietal lobes, left parietal lobe, and splenium of corpus callosum. Loss of gray-white differentiation concerning for ischemic change. Increased right to left midline shift. TCDs demonstrated moderate spasm of the L MCA. EEG without seizure. Started Pentobarbital coma. On 12/9, an occurred episode while in transport to MRI and patient was noted to be obtunded. ICP 11 during episode, EVDs patent. She was not connected to LTM during episode, as she was in transport. She was started on epi drip and became more responsive, moving spontaneously and withdrawing to pain. On 12/10, her neurostorming medication regimen was optimized and no further changes were made.    Given poor neurologic prognosis, patient was given adequate sedation for pain management during terminal extubation on 12/18.  CV: Had periods of hypotension intraoperatively requiring initiation of Epinephrine and Norepinephrine infusions to maintain goal MAP > 80, SBP > 120. Returned to PICU with femoral CVL, arterial line, sedated with Fentanyl and Dexmedetomidine infusions, and on Vecuronium infusions, Nimodipine. On 12/4 echocardiogram report noted significant for left ventricular mid-inferoseptal hypokinesis and moderately diminished left ventricular systolic function, with an LVEF 41%. She required titration of pressors to maintain goal pressures. Added stress dose Hydrocortisone. Repeat echocardiogram demonstrated significant improvement in LV systolic function, consistent with the hypothesis that myocardium was neurologically stunned. 12/6-12/8 Patient weaned from sedation and pressors. On 12/9 she experienced a hypotensive episode while in transport to MRI.  HR dropped to 40s-50s. 105 mcg Epi dwindle given, then started on Epi drip, given 500 mL NS push pull. HR and BP normalized. On 12/10, patient was weaned from pressors and stress dose steroids. She remained hemodynamically appropriate leading to terminal extubation on 12/18.   RESP: Intubated in the OR. Notably, course complicated by significant pulmonary edema with poor compliance. On 12/10, her ventilator settings were weaned to CPAP/PS. She remained hemodynamically appropriate with CPAP/PS until terminal extubation on 12/18.   FEN/GI: On 12/10 patient was started on enteral feeds which were discontinued after terminal extubation on 12/18.   ID: At ED, she was incidentally found to be COVID positive. Blood cultures were drawn at that time positive for strep viridans. She started on empiric Cefepime and Vancomycin due to concern for septic shock given pressor requirements. Initiated thermoregulation. Patient continued to be intermittently febrile and remained on Ceftriaxone per family's wishes until 12/19.   RENAL: Initially had significantly increased urine output. Labs concerning for DI, although could also be secondary to 3% boluses. Initiated DI protocol. This later resolved and she continued to have urine output appropriate for age leading to her terminal extubation on 12/18.   OTHER: On 12/5 ,discussion took place between provider and mother and placed partial code status, including no bolus cardiac resuscitative medications, no defibrillation, no chest compressions. Care Conference took place on 12/10, during which mother voiced she would like to get MRI for further neuroprognostication before changing goals of care. Care conference on 12/14 to discuss MRI results with family. Neurology explained likely deficits patient will experience as a result of her brain injury including weakness of both sides of her body, inability to walk, inability to effectively eat PO, personality changes, cognitive dysfunction. Mother voices """"Patient would not want to live like this,"""" but requests time to discuss these options with family before making any decisions. Another discussion between providers and family on 12/15 during which family voiced they would not want patient to be reintubated once extubated, would not want her to receive blood products, and would like to continue with enteral feeding. Tentative plans for extubation on 12/17 or 12/18 once family from out of state has come to say their goodbyes. Family later decided to move forward with terminal extubation on 12/18. She was extubated 12/18 to room air and passed away on 12/19/2021 @ 20:37 PM with mother, brother and step father at the bedside.","Head CT, MRI, Echocardiogram, multiple ultrasounds, angiogram",None

Repeat twelve-lead EKG at 1:26 PM, performed about 2 h after the initial EKG, shows persistent ST elevation in leads I and aVL with 0.5 mm ST depression in lead III only.

The events """"diagnosed with cdiff"""", """"rectal bleeding"""" and """"she was experiencing recurring gi bleeding"""" were evaluated at the physician office visit and emergency room visit. The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: GI inflammatory markers: high. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of clostridium difficile infection, rectal haemorrhage, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and included treatment with vancomycin antibiotic. Clinical course: Reporter's daughter started experiencing rectal bleeding over the summer. Her GI inflammatory markers were high and she was diagnosed with CDiff despite not being on recent antibiotics or being in a hospital or nursing home. Because this happened over 2 months after the vaccine administration, it did not occur to reporter that this was a potential adverse event. However, given that she was experiencing recurring GI bleeding and a friend just texted about her mom dying with heart and lung inflammation (separate record report), reporter was wondering if she was having a long term inflammatory reaction due to the vaccine.; Sender's Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the event clostridium difficile infection, rectal haemorrhage, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and the suspect vaccine COMIRNATY cannot be excluded.

A positive result (based on 99th percentile cutoff) indicates the presence of PS/PT (phosphatidylserine/prothrombin complex) IgG or IgM antibodies and suggests the possibility of certain autoimmune disease thrombotic disorders, such as APS or those secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus or other lupus-like thrombotic diseases.  A negative result indicates no PS/PT IgG or IgM antibodies or levels below the detection limit of the assay cutoff.  2. It is to be expected that some samples can be anticardiolipin positive and/or anti-B2 GPI positive yet PS/PT IgG or IgM negative. The anti-B2 GPI test is a specific marker of thrombotic risk. The anticardiolipin test can produce false positive results due to cross-reactivity with dsDNA or certain infectious disease antibodies.

His presentation included chest pain and elevated troponins (normalized). He had a normal echo, normal EKG. His troponin and CRP are pending and will be added once they are resulted.  He has not had any further chest pain. The family is very medically knowledgeable (mom is a neurologist and dad is a scientist). At this time, they have decided not to pursue a cardiac MRI but will have one in March 2022. We discussed what we know about post vaccine myocarditis and, in this setting, we follow similar guidelines as those with myocarditis in order to give the myocardium time to heal. Dr discussed our recommendations for activity restrictions. Pt. should be restricted from competitive/vigorous sports for the next 2-3 months and will return for a cardiac MRI for LGE in March, 2022.",As per #18,Food allergies

The left forearm nodule had a hyperpigmented streak starting at the nodule and extending toward the hand. Her differential included nodular lymphangitis felt less likely due to lack of exposures and BL findings, new viral infection such as EBV, CMV, complications of the COVID itself or a reaction to her Sotrovimab. A Hepatitis panel was negative and EBV and CMV titers were sent and serial CMPs were ordered. She was initially just admitted on motrin prn with her home medications, PO ad lib and MIVFs. Infectious Disease and Heme Onc were consulted. By the next morning, her physical exam was notable for an """"L"""" shaped hyperpigmented, painful lesion on the left forearm and this and her other lesions seemed more hard and cord like more so than mobile nodules or lymph nodes. Given this and the fact that she had multiple risk factors for increase risk of clotting (lupus anticoagulant, obesity, birth control, acute COVID-19 infection, and venous stasis), physical exam findings were felt to be most consistent with superficial thrombophlebitis. Pediatric ID and Heme/Onc agreed. A hypercoagulable work-up was initiated and she was started on Lovenox 40mg BID (prophylactic dose) for at least 2 weeks, stopping her estrogen-containing birth control during this time. She did develop some posterior calf and BL foot pain with a cord over her R foot and BL foot hyperpigmented streaking but these rapidly resolved and her UE lesions greatly improved. She'd also remained afebrile in house and repeat BL LE doppler was also again negative. By the day of discharge she had only some improving L forearm pain with improved TTP and discoloration and only mild BL AC TTP with minimal remaining masses with superficial changes.  Heme Onc thus did not feel she needed increased to therapeutic dosing or Anti-Xa levels. Her mother, pharmacy, ID and Heme Onc were all okay with discharge to home. Her mother, already familiar with giving her sister injections for eczema, was easily able to take over her Lovenox injection in house and voiced comfort with doing so at home. She was then sent home in good condition. Her d-dimer was only mildly elevated at 612 and her homocyteine and ATIII had resulted as nml with Prothrombin, Factor V Leiden, Lipoprotein A, Pro C and Pro S as well as her EBV and CMV titers all still pending at the time of discharge.  She will be followed up in 2 weeks at Hematology and ID. The length of her Lovenox and hold on OCPs will be readdressed at that time.   Transaminitis with hyperbili and mild hypoalbuminemia on RUQ Pain, N/V, poor PO On admission, Hepatitis panel was normal and EBV/CMV testing were still in process at the time of discharge. Transaminitis was felt to be secondary to viral infection versus regular tylenol use during her COVID-19 infection versus COVID-19 itself. Throughout admission, CMP were trended. Her bili normlized, her alb dipped to 3.3 but was back up to 3.7 and AST and ALT downtrended to 82 and 526 respectively. Her RUQ tenderness improved some and then stabilized, her N/V resolved and her oral intake improved. She will continue to avoid tylenol (and motrin given her Lovenox) and needs another repeat CMP on 1/19/22 to continue to follow.   Mild Hyperchloremic Acidosis on Dehydration Her Cl- bumped to 115 likely from her IVFs with a likely related mild acidosis to 19. Ketosis and her dehydration may have played roles as well. Her UOP normalized and her PO intake improved as above. She was off IVFs by HD#2. Her Cl and HCO3 improved to stable at 110 and 18 on last checks.    Abnormal urine Her nurse noted some possible urine sediment on the night prior to d/c.

She presented on 1/26 after 1 week of symptoms of myalgias and cough and having already tested positive for COVID-19 on 1/24/2022.  She has home oxygen needs 0.5 L by nasal cannula but had increased needs up to 1 L by nasal cannula.  At her dialysis prior to admission she was tachycardic and increased respiratory support she will pursue further evaluation in the ED.  She was initially fluid resuscitated but given her mitral stenosis this was stopped given concern for worsening interstitial fluid on chest x-ray.  She was started on maintenance fluids.  Empirically started on meropenem with concern for sepsis.  Laboratory studies showed leukopenia of 3.3, pro-Cal 1.9 and CRP at 19.8.  She was initially admitted to C4 for further management.   She fired sepsis alert on the floor.  At 0430 on 1/27 she had an aspiration event related to trying to drink while coughing.  She desaturated to the 60s with this episode.  She was noted to have increased work of breathing and higher oxygen needs and the decision was made to admit her to the PICU for high flow nasal cannula support.   Brief PICU course:   Respiratory: She was admitted to the PICU on HFNC 25 L at 60% FiO2.  Initially, she was tachypneic in the high 40s-low 50s with accessory muscle use and bilateral coarse rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally with occasional expiratory wheezing.  She was maintained on her pulmonary sick plan  and received treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia with remdesivir and dexamethasone.  She continued on empiric meropenem until blood cultures were negative >48 hours. We were able to wean from HFNC to NC on 1/29/22. On 2/1 she had acute and profound decompensation of her respiratory status with desaturations to 60%, minimally responsive to CPAP. Given level of respiratory distress, decision was made to intubate to allow for optimal lung recovery given severity of Covid pneumonia. Over the coming weeks she had progressively worsening compliance and progression of her respiratory failure, which acutely worsened on the evening of 2/13 into 2/14.  She developed subcutaneous air and pneumothoraces.  She had a right sided chest tube placed without improvement in ventilation.  Also attempted iNO without improvement in cardiac output or arterial saturations.  She was transitioned to the oscillator without success and she developed a new left sided pneumothorax.  The family had previously gave patient an altered code status after discussion with Dr.  Despite attempt to decompress her left pneumothorax, patient had progressive desaturation leading to bradycardia and hypotension. At that point we asked her family to be with her.  At 1158 on 2/14 she was pronounced deceased.     CV: Initially on arrival to PICU was maintaining reasonable indices of perfusion however did require inotropic support throughout course. Inotropic support was escalated with worsening compliance as high ventilatory pressures impeded output. On 2/7, patient had an acute event with worsening tachycardia and worsening mixed venous saturation. Sedation was increased and neuromuscular blockade performed with associated drops in NIRs. Bedside ECHO performed and notable for findings of new right sided atrial and ventricular dilation as well as decreased right sided function concerning for new pulmonary hypertension. Patient initially anticoagulated with heparin drip until stable for CTA which was ultimately negative for PE. A trial of iNO was also done without clinical improvement. During acute worsening on 2/14 and repeat ECHO was obtained and notable for similar findings, but not acutely worse.    FEN/GI: She was maintained on home feeding regimen upon arrival to PICU but required transition to NG feeds after intubation but enteral feeds were not tolerated well. Thus patient started TPN/IL to meet nutritional requirements while intubated. From a transplant perspective, patient's sirolimus levels were closely monitored while inpatient and necessary dose adjustments were made per hepatology recommendations. She continued on bowel regimen and scheduled zofran.    Renal: Patient was transitioned from hemodialysis to CRRT. She overall did well with this. Some concern that event on 2/7/22 was related to citrate lock, but patient tolerated transition back to citrate without further incidence.    ID: She received dexamethasone and remdesivir for Covid. Blood, urine and ETT cultures initially no growth to date. She was initially on meropenem for 48 hours for rule out of superimposed bacterial pneumonia and was discontinued with clinical improvement. However, upon intubation and respiratory support escalation, she was re-started on meropenem for suspected superimposed bacterial pneumonia. She was switched to Avycaz per ID and completed a 10 day course. Blood cultures were obtained during her acute worsening on 2/7/22 and ultimately grew enterococcus faecium. She was started on vancomycin. ETT also cultured at that time with polymicrobial growth. Decision made to not treat this growth unless clinically worsening. Patient was given a therapeutic dose of fluconazole on 2/14 due to worsening of respiratory status. She continued on her dapsone, valgancyclovir and fluconazole for her baseline infection prophylaxis.     Endocrine: She was aintained on stress dose steroids, hydrocortisone 50 mg 3 times daily.  Her home dose of prednisone 5 mg twice daily was held while on stress dose steroids. Also received dexamethasone 3.5 mg daily in the setting of her Covid pneumonia. She was transitioned to her home dose steroids on 2/11/22 with wean of hydrocortisone complete on 2/13/22. She also received one dose of stress dose steroids on the morning of 2/14 due to acute decompensation. She required an insulin drip while on stress dose steroids due to poor glycemic control.","",Kabuki syndrmome s/p liver transplant End stage renal disease Intersitial lung disease with chronic cough Mitral valve stenosis

Your healthcare provider knows your health situation and has access to information that can better help inform this decision. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post authorization use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

Symptoms began the same day sh received influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations and in the context of known exposure to siblings with cold-like symptoms 1.5 months prior to admission.    In detail, her symptoms began 11/15/21 with fevers of 102 -103 degF, occurring hours after receiving an influenza vaccine and her first COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer) at a well child visit earlier in the day. On day 2 of illness, she developed abdominal pain, nausea, loose stools, and her fevers continued. On day 3-4 of illness, she developed a diffuse confluent sunburn-like rash on her abdomen, chest, and face, which spread to her  arms (no involvement of palms/soles). Conjunctival injection developed by day 4 of illness and the rash worsened. She was brought to the ED on day 5 of illness when she felt her vision was a little blurry, where she was found to be hypotensive requiring a fluid bolus and she was admitted to the PICU. She was found to have multisystem inflammation with acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, myocarditis with elevated serum troponins but no compromised function, and vasodilatory shock.  Studies were consistent with MISC with hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, increased echogenicity of the kidneys on ultrasound, acute kidney injury with Cr of 3.6, elevated CRP, pro-calcitonin, ESR, BNP, troponin, D-dimer, and fibrinogen, hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytopenia, as well as lymphopenia (normal WBC and low absolute lymphocyte count of 800 cells/uL). Her echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function, coronary arteries and anatomy. EKG was normal. CXR was normal. Initial differential diagnosis included MISC, shock KD, toxic shock syndrome, sepsis, less likely tick-born illness (no high risk exposures). Lower extremity dopplers were normal. Sepsis/ID workup was negative by blood cultures, respiratory viral multiplex nasopharyngeal PCR panel, COVID-19 nasopharyngeal PCR, ehrlichia and anaplasma serologies and PCRs, rickettsia rickettsii serologies, and a strep A PCR test from outside pediatrics clinic was negative 2 days prior to admission. COVID-19 serologies were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody (qualitative) and spike antibody (titer of 182 U/mL; normal reference < 0.8 U/mL), indicating a past infection which was felt to be the trigger for her MIS-C.    She was treated for MIS-C with IVIG, steroids, lovenox, and high dose aspirin. Lisinopril was given for elevated blood pressures presumably secondary to steroids. Empirical antibiotics for possible sepsis or toxic shock syndrome (ceftriaxone, clindamycin, vancomycin) were discontinued 48 hours of blood culture negativity and with no evidence of focal infection. She had excellent clinical recovery on MIS-C treatments. Pressors with norepinephrine were weaned off within 12 hours of admission, and her rash and fevers quickly resolved along with her other presenting symptoms. Inflammatory markers eventually were all improving by the day of discharge 11/24/22. She was discharged to home on weaning oral steroids, lovenox, aspirin, lisinopril. Upon hematology and cardiology outpatient follow up over the next two months (visits on 12/1/21 and 1/12/22 with repeat labs 1/3/22), she was doing well without any cardiac symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or syncope. She was noted to have demonstrated full recovery and with no recurrence of symptoms or inflammation on repeat labs (1/3/22) after coming off the steroids (completed 12/27/21). Lovenox was stopped 12/1/21. Aspirin was stopped 1/12/22 after her vW and FVIII levels normalized indicating resolution of vasculitis. She received her second COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer) on 1/13/22.

The next morning, around 4-5AM on Saturday the 15th, he woke up complaining of a sore throat. When he woke up at 8am he still complained about the sore throat. Gave him some hot chocolate and it felt better and it was gone. He didn't have it again until around 5pm the same day. He complained about the throat being sore again. I gave him an at-home test which came back negative. He didn't complain anymore then went to bed. He woke up at 10pm and complained again and he seemed to have a fever. He had a popsicle, and he just couldn't sleep and that his throat was sore. I offered to take him to emergent care, and he said no. he was struggling to sleep well and gave him fever reducing medication. At around 6-7am, he was still complaining, and he said he didn't feel good. And still had a fever. Took him to urgent care. They did a strep test culture and rapid, and the COVID PCR test. The COVID PCR came back positive. On Sunday, the fever was still occurring, he was lethargic. Throat was hurting. Didn't want to drink or eat. His fever broke about 10-11pm on Sunday. He had this fever for about 24 hours. He woke up on Monday and bounced back to being normal. He didn't complain about a sore throat anymore and viewed himself as normal. So, by Wednesday or Thursday, a cough appeared. He did on Sunday have a cough like a fake cough. 2-3 days after when he felt better was when the cough came. The cough was deeper and he never had phlegm and didn't have anything come up. Sounded like an adult deep cough. He had that for 2-2 1/2 weeks. The cough subsided and I would hear him clear this throat constantly. Towards the end of February, I brought him to the pediatrician and she said his nasal passages were swollen, possibly allergies. She recommended putting him on CLARITIN ever since. He doesn't have the throat clearing like he used to, but if I miss a day, he starts to feel weird. Not sure if it's an allergy thing or because of COVID. He was sick a couple weeks ago as well. This last time I took him to the office and they did a rapid test and it came back negative. His symptoms were nearing what COVID was. He had a fever, cough appeared later. He didn't have a confirmed COVID test, but I'm concerned he had it again.

She fell over, almost losing consciousness, three more times that morning.  From that point on, Patient was """"dizzy"""" or lightheaded daily. She had been an avid athlete, playing soccer at least three times per week and teaching swim lessons 4 times a week. She began to have to sit out at soccer practice and to have to leave the field during soccer games. Her dizziness was worse with exertion. She was treated zealously for assumed dehydration, but it did not help. She continued to be more and more dizzy until in January she had to quit her job teaching swim lessons because she would get dizzy in the pool where she was watching young kids. She is home schooled and only attends school twice a week, but she did miss school at least 6 times from dizziness (and more due to heart surgery but I am not counting that). Patient stopped playing soccer completely  in November due to her symptoms.  In the quest to try to find out what was wrong, her pediatrician, (since retired), found a first degree AV block on her EKG. She was referred to cardiology where she was diagnosed with a 17mm atrial septal defect. Her cardiologist, thought this could be causing the dizziness. The ASD was repaired on 3/2/22 with open heart surgery. Patient felt less dizzy for a day or two while in the hospital, but unfortunately after a week it was clear that the symptoms had not gone away. After further testing (blood pressure tests, holter monitor) she was diagnosed by Dr. with POTS/Disautonomia. Dr. said this could have been caused by her COVID vaccine, especially condsidering the timing of onset and never having symptoms before the vaccine. Dr said disautonomia was a possible side effect of the vaccines. At this time, a year after the vaccine, Patient is still suffering with debilitating dizziness and light-headedness not associated with dehydration.

It didn't hurt to touch, it was just swollen and hard, it was about 2 in. We waited another week and it didn't go down and seemed to be growing in size and so we decided to go to pediatrician on the 25th. They didn't know anything about it, weren't sure, and they asked us to go and get an x-ray of it. We got a chest x-ray to make sure there weren't any other swollen lymph nodes on February 11th, showed no other lymph nodes other than the one on his jawline. They basically told us to hold off and wait and monitor it and it might go down. So we waited, and then on March 28th we went to an ENT. At this point it was still growing, it didn't hurt him but it was very visible. We went to the specialist and they told us that it was unusual that it had been 3 months of this and ordered a CT scan and that was done on 3/28 and at that time they couldn't decide if it was actually his parotid gland or a lymph node. They were concerned it could be cancerous so they wanted to have a biopsy done. We went in on 5/5/22 to an urgent care and when they read the sample of the biopsy they saw that it was lymphatic material and were quite certain it was a lymph node. Based off of that we had a spinal visit with Dr. again in May, and they said it was a good chance it was a reaction to the booster shot and reactive """"benign reactive lymph node"""" and to keep monitoring it and if it doesn't go down to go back in to have it removed.

On 12/5, pain worsened to the point that he had difficulty walking as well as worsening urinary retention, prompting admission to the hospital for further workup. He underwent extensive workup from 12/5-12/12 (summarized in Item 19), all of which was inconclusive. However, his clinical exam improved while inpatient, so he was subsequently discharged with supportive care and outpatient PT.

On 6/10/2021 we saw Dr., who diagnosed Pt with Uveitis and referred us to Uveitis specialist, Dr. and Dr. Dr. prescribe Pred Forte, which Pt used for 2 weeks, however, no improvement was seen, so Dr. prescribed Durazol. We attempted to wean Pt off of Durazol 3 times between July 2021 and February 2022, but the Uveitis did not clear and Pt continued to experience flare ups. In February 2022, we switched to Methotrexate when Pt began to develop cataracts from the Durazol and the continued Uveitis flares. We were able to fully end Durazol drops in May 2022 with the Methotrexate treatment. Trace cells continued to persist into June 2022 with exclusive Methotrexate treatment, so we increased the dosage to the maximum. In July 2022 Pt was nearly clear of all trace cells on the maximum dosage of Methotrexate, which we inject weekly. Our plan is to continue this treatment for 2 years or more if needed.  Our hope is that we will eventually be able to wean Pt off of the Methotrexate. We are hoping that she does not experience any of the very sever potential complications from Methotrexate. We are monitoring  the cataracts effect on Pt's vision and will begin to meet with doctors to discuss future cataract surgery. At this time the final outcome of Pt's vaccine induced Uveitis event is unknown.",Full panel of rheumatology tests ordered by Dr. showed no underlying conditions related to Uveitis.,None
