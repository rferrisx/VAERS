He also asked if the ingredient Hexane was a poison, if this is safe. The patient had some questions, he is really worried because he has seemed to be experiencing something. He is wondering if Erectile Dysfunction has been reported as a problem from the COVID vaccine. He seemed to be experiencing worsening of his sexual function, and the only thing that is new that he can think, is that he got the vaccination. He received the second dose of the product on 26Jan2021. He asked how long the MRNA last in your system,  how many people were involved in the study, When did it start, if the hexane solvent in the vaccine affect your testes. It was further reported that he was having a bad reaction he believe to the vaccination (Covid Vaccine) and asked if there were any reports of erectile dysfunction or sexual dysfunction regarding males from the vaccine. The patient had an article here it says your system mounts a response against the new protein, because they are seen as foreign invaders, developing antibodies that are specific to SARS-CoV-2 in the process. These infection fighters tick around to help your body fight a future case of Covid-19 but it's not yet understood for how long and this is the sense he wanted to talk to about that body will do its thing and eventually will get rid of the protein or mRNA on its own? The patient said since he had taken the COVID-19 Vaccine injections he has experienced worsening erective dysfunction. He asked if anyone else has reported having that issue since receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. He was advised he would be transferred to Medical Information for further assistance. He stated he is so sad, and started crying while speaking with the agent. He declined to answer any further questions and asked to be transferred to Medical Information to have his question addressed. He asked the agent if she knew that Hexane is in the Pfizer COVID- 19 Vaccine. He said he did not realize Hexane was in the COVID-19 Vaccine before he got the vaccine.

The company he worked for at the time had a hepatitis break out, a couple of employees had hepatitis, so they had him receive the gamma globulin vaccine. Vaccine/Brand Name: Gamma globulin vaccine/brand name unknown, whatever it was that was available for hepatitis at the time which he thinks would have been 1972. He is pretty sure in those days they used horse serum in the gamma globulin vaccine; the doctors at the time felt pretty sure that the reaction was to the horse serum aspect of the gamma globulin vaccine.

Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it's a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller clarified he has no first hand knowledge of those other patients/events/products, this was just mentioned to him by the doctor over the phone. He had no further information to provide for this report; but doctor might be able to provide further information.

They did X-rays and scan of his abdomen to monitor intestinal blockage-results unknown. Blood work done but nothing remarkable there-results unknown. His blood pressure actually was low while in hospital-specific results unknown. Glucose levels were very high while in hospital which he is sure was because they had him on an IV drip that must have had glucose in it because he was not eating anything and when in pain and anxiety his sugar goes up-further details of results unknown.

REASSESSMENT   6:35 PM Patient presents to the ED and was seen at bedside. I discussed the patient's case with him and informed him of his atrial fibrillation.   7:43 PM I discussed the patient's case and the above findings with Dr. (Cardiology) about the patient's condition.   7:54 PM  I reevaluated the patient at bedside. The patient informs me they feel improved following Eliquis and IV fluid administration. I discussed the patient's diagnostic study results. I discussed plan for discharge and follow up as outlined below. The patient verbalizes they feel comfortable going home. The patient is stable for discharge at this time and will return for any new or worsening symptoms. Patient verbalizes understanding and support with my plan for discharge.    HYDRATION: Based on the patient's presentation of Tachycardia the patient was given IV fluids. IV Hydration was used because oral hydration was not adequate alone and patient presents with dizziness. Upon recheck following hydration, the patient was improved.     COURSE & MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Nursing notes, VS, PMSFHx reviewed in chart.   Patient a male who comes in for evaluation of dizziness.  Differential diagnosis includes dehydration, vaccination side effect, arrhythmia, electrolyte disturbance, acute coronary syndrome.  Diagnostic work-up includes labs and EKG.   Patient's initial vitals are within normal limits.  He is treated with IV fluids for his dizziness and decreased oral intake over the last day secondary to his vaccine.  EKG returns and demonstrates new onset atrial fibrillation which is already rate controlled likely as patient is on metoprolol for his cardiomyopathy.  EKG is nonischemic.  Patient's labs returned and are unremarkable.  Electrolytes are within normal limits.  Troponin is within normal limits and EKG is nonischemic making acute coronary syndrome unlikely.  Patient has a HEART score of 3 making him low risk for acute coronary syndrome.  I discussed the case with cardiologist Dr. who agrees that since patient is doing well he can be discharged home to follow-up in clinic.  She does recommend initiating apixaban therapy for his atrial fibrillation as his CHA2DS2-VASc score is 2.  I discussed this with patient and discussed risks and benefits of apixaban.  I discussed his stroke risk with him.  After discussion patient is amenable to initiating apixaban therapy.  I did discuss avoiding sports in which he could have traumatic brain injury as he is high risk for bleeding when initiating anticoagulation.  Patient understands and is amenable to this plan.  He is started on apixaban and will follow up in clinic with his cardiologist Dr. He has been given strict return precautions and discharged in stable condition.    The patient will return for new or worsening symptoms and is stable at the time of discharge.   The patient is referred to a primary physician for blood pressure management, diabetic screening, and for all other preventative health concerns.   DISPOSITION: Patient will be discharged home in stable condition.

Consults Physician at 4/4/2021  7:39 PM I was called to discuss this patients care with. We discussed atrial fibrillation management.   Briefly, this old man with history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy and dyslipiemia who came in with flulike symptoms and dizziness.  The patient had his second shot of Covid vaccine on 4/2/2021.  The patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation on EKG here (new onset).  The patient's heart rate has been 60s-70s mostly while in the ER.  Labs have been unremarkable, and the patient's symptoms have since resolved as per the ER physician.  Given CHA2DS2-VASc of at least 2, I would recommend starting some anticoagulation.  Continue home metoprolol, which seems to be controlling the patient's HR.  If the patient remains in A. fib, can consider TEE/DCCV or DCCV after 3 weeks of uninterrupted anticoagulation.   At this time it was deemed no formal in person cardiology consultation was necessary, however if this changes due to changes in patient condition or abnormal test results, please re-consult cardiology.

Medical history included transient ischaemic attack (TIA) from 2019 to an unknown date, mild hypertension, idiopathic neuropathy: in the left leg, started in the beginning of the year from 2019, melanoma removed in the 1970s, enlarged prostate, neuropathy, cholesterol and fluid retention. Ongoing concomitant medications included tamsulosin taken for enlarged prostate; gabapentin taken for neuropathy; candesartan taken for hypertension; pravastatin taken for cholesterol; acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); and furosemide (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE]) taken for fluid retention. The patient has been taking all of his meds for quite some time, over 5 years. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 09Mar2021 10:30 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient completed the Pfizer COVID vaccine series, the second shot was on 30Mar2021. On 09Apr2021, the patient had an embolic stroke. The patient's daughter stated that the patient has a history of TIA in 2019 and was concerned. She does not know if it was related. She added it might be that if people have previous risk, there may be some precautions, like to take a full dose of aspirin before, a week before. She sent an e-mail last 05May2021 and hasn't gotten a response back. The patient went to the ER due to embolic stroke and was in the hospital Friday (09Apr2021) through Wednesday. The patient went to the stroke rehab center for 3 weeks. The daughter clarified that the patient was in the hospital until 14 or 15Apr2021 before being transferred (also reported as 5 or 6 days and in rehab for three weeks). Then was discharged last 06May2021. The patient's condition seemed to be getting better. His major issue was speech and wasn't able to formulate any words. He was able to speak now. His rehab would be a lot of neurological rehab and speech therapy. The patient previously had left sided weakness on his leg from some random thing that happened. It didn't seem to get worse. It really affected his speech and cognition. The patient's daughter thought that the embolic stroke was related to the Pfizer Covid vaccine and added that thought was in some way but cannot say in what way. She thought that it exacerbated some type of blood clotting. She stated that he never had blood clotting issues before and was the type of person that would take a baby aspirin and get a nose bleed, he was the opposite of a clotter. An MRI in the hospital showed blood clot and stroke. He had blood work but does not know what it showed and presumed he was fine (unknown results).

She was his wife of 63 years. He has a real problem. It was complicated. His birthday was (DOB) and he would be 90 years old this summer. He had hip surgery on 14Dec2020. The surgery was at (Hospital Name). He was diagnosed with CIDP which was chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The treatment for CIDP was IVIg infusion. He had infusions for five consecutive days on 24Dec, 25Dec, 26Dec, 27Dec, and 28Dec (unspecified year). He wanted to get COVID vaccine. Pfizer does not have a lot of information for people who get IVIg infusions. On 19Jan2021 he got Pfizer's COVID vaccine and had no problems. On 01Feb2021 he had IVIg infusion because he has to wait 28 days between infusions. They had checked with the neurologist and they said a week then they changed it to 10 days. The neurologist said to go ahead because it was nine days. On 09Feb2021 he got second COVID vaccine. That was Tuesday. He was feeling great and walked into the place to get it. He was ok. He woke up yesterday and he was aching all over especially where he had the surgical hip revision on 10Feb2021 at 07:00. It was six inches above the knee to the top of the groin. It was a sharp pain. When he tries to lift his leg to walk it was especially sharp. He was trying to call the surgeon, but he was in surgery all day. The neurologist said to call Pfizer for any information about people who get IVIg infusion and have chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and the COVID vaccine. He walked into (Name) which was where he got it and he felt great. He walked out and came home. He has had no falls or nothing. He just came home. It was like a mystery. There was not a whole lot of information from Pfizer for people that get IVIg infusions except it started with seven days and now wait 10 days. She was trying to research it on the computer and it only says vaccines in general. It says there might be problem with vaccinations with infusions and she has read the literature that pertained to that. The article she read was from three years ago. It may just be a real unusual kind of thing that a person would have IVIg and get the COVID vaccine. She has been on hold for an hour. She has medical power of attorney for her husband. He had no problem with the first one at all. On the vaccine card she could not read the person's handwriting. Waited to do COVID vaccine on 19Jan2021 when he was in skilled nursing facility. He was in the hospital for 18 days and then went to the skilled nursing facility for 12 days. The only thing that was relevant was did the IVIg have an effect with the COVID vaccine because nothing else had changed. That was the only different thing. Morning after - body pain with continued sharp pain in left leg groin area - site of recent hip replacement on 10Feb2021 at 07:00. Morning of 13Feb2021- rash on right leg - calf region. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment was received for the adverse events.

1400220,"",45,M,"","",Y,Blood test Hypoaesthesia Lumbar puncture Muscle twitching Paraesthesia,"After I got my 1st COVID shot (Moderna April 6th), I started noticing my thumbs get numb and tingly (Hypoesthesia). At first I disregarded it because, a year ago, I had a mild spinal cord injury (requiring a neck brace). And after wearing the brace, I had a similar symptom that would flare up. So, when my thumbs did this, I figured, ?perhaps it?s my old injury just flaring up?? But, this time, the hypoesthesia began engulfing my pinky fingers too. I was obviously disturbed; but, I also figured it could simply be stress and carpal tunnel. This continued throughout the month in a mild way. After my 2nd COVID shot (May 4th), the tingly numbness spread to both heels and toes. And in the week following the vaccination, the numbness started to quickly shoot up both of my legs? all the way to the top of my butt cheeks. And finally, even my testicles started feeling tingly and numb.  It got to the point where I could barely handle sitting down for more than 10 minutes. My calf muscles also started to constantly twitch. So, with Guillain Barre Syndrome on my mind, I went into the E.R. They did a spinal tap and the labs came back normal. A month later, the symptoms slowly began to subside.","May 10th - Spinal Tap in ER to rule out Guillain Barre - Tests came back normal May 17th - I did blood tests to rule out Diabetes related neuropathy - Hypothyroid - Tests came back normal May 18th - I talked to my Rheumatologist to discuss possible side-effects with my TNF blockers (Cimzia) The following week, I talked to a Neurologist about the possibility that this numbness was related to my old neck injury.  But, as the numbness has slowly subsided, we concluded that it was an inflammatory response to the vaccine and not something more sinister."

Acute respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were likely due to exacerbation of underlying PAH and COPD. Pyrexia, tachycardia, hypotension were possibly a reaction to Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

Went to urgent care they ran labs, liver levels were elevated as well as blood pressure.   Have had 2 severe panic attacks that have wakened me up from my sleep, thought I was having a heart attack. Called 911, they checked vitals and did ECG, everything came back normal.   I?ve also have had a looming feeling of impending doom and dread that comes and goes out of nowhere; I?ve never had this before and it?s the most terrifying thing ever.   My appetite has been significantly lower to non-existent.  The first 48 hours after receiving the shot I was insatiably hungry, which is also unusual, but as the weeks have gone one I have had little to no appetite.   At times I feel as though I?m in a fog; brain fog, and slightly spacey. This is intermittent. I?ve also had some chest pressure, not really pains, and some heart palpitations. Haven?t had shortness of breath or fatigue thank god!    Lastly, and the most strange adverse reaction is I haven?t been able to get an erection. I used to have regular morning erections, but that?s been non-existent since I got the shot.","Blood work has been done twice, both times they?ve shown my liver levels were above normal. The second test showed they had come down slightly, but still above normal. My blood work had always been within healthy/normal limits prior to this.   I?ve had 2 ECG?s - one when I called 911 from my panic attack which happened in the middle of the night on 07/31, it was normal. Also had one done at follow up with physician on 08/07 - which is the same appointment where we did follow up blood work to my urgent care visit for the tingling in arms, hands and feet - and that too was normal.

I woke up with a general sense of fatigue (probably from my lack of sleep/experiences), but also dizziness and some lingering pain in my testicles. After 2-3 days after my shot the symptoms faded away.  The only remaining symptom is a slight tightness of the chest, something that I would usually only feel during a highly stressful moment. But no chest tightness that I would categorize as """"painful.""""","My wife encouraged me to not go to my care provider and try to sleep it off. I am now only learning about the VAERS system, and thought it wise to report my experiences. I still feel the slight tightness in my chest, but cannot get an appointment with my PCP.

He is transfer from a local hospital.  He was driving his motorcycle approximately 25 to 30 miles an hour when he rear-ended his brother-in-law, striking the steering column and being thrown onto his left side.  He sustained a left elbow laceration which underwent primary repair with facility.  He is complaining of severe groin pain as well as chest wall discomfort.  Prior to the injury he was independently ambulatory without assistive devices and denies any history of previous groin or pelvic surgeries.  He is right-hand dominant.  He is complaining of some mild pain in his right elbow as well.  He was unable to ambulate after the accident..  He denies any numbness or tingling in his legs.  He denies any personal or family history of DVT, PE, problems with anesthesia.  He is retired.  Lives in Perryville, MO.    Assessment and Plan: Patient is a 63-year-old male with APC 2 pelvic ring injury and extraperitoneal bladder rupture, as well as left arm road rash and right elbow pain/limited motion   Discussed with patient his brother natural history and treatment options for unstable left pelvic ring injury with evidence of anterior disruption more than 2.5 cm and some suggestion of left SI instability as well as well as associated bladder rupture.  Multidisciplinary conversation held with Dr of urology and Dr of trauma in formulation of treatment plan..  We discussed treatment options including nonoperative management, external fixation, as well as open reduction internal fixation.  Discussed my plan would be to start with an exam under anesthesia.  Given his age, obese status, would not recommend an external fixator.  If there is evidence of complete disruption of the sacroiliac ligaments, he will require associated posterior fixation as well.  After exam under anesthesia is complete, we will plan to proceed with combined open reduction internal fixation of the anterior pubic diastases as well as displaced superior pubic ramus fracture with combined repair of extraperitoneal bladder injury to be performed by urology.  Additional posterior fixation would be dictated by instability based off preoperative exam.  We discussed risks of surgery including bleeding, infection, nonunion,, damage to local structures including lumbosacral nerve roots, sexual dysfunction including erectile dysfunction dyspareunia which are noted to be significantly increased with this pattern of injury regardless of treatment option, chronic pain, DVT, PE, intraoperative cardiopulmonary event, recurrent bladder rupture..  After discussion of risks and benefits, patient agrees to proceed with surgical intervention.  We discussed that right lower extremity weightbearing status will be dictated by exam under anesthesia instability after fixation   1. Weight bearing status: Bedrest until the OR.  Weightbearing as tolerated bilateral upper extremities for now.  Continue to monitor right upper extremity pain and motion with consideration of CT to evaluate for occult fracture if persistent limitation of motion 2. Anticoagulation Recommendations: Started on Lovenox within 24 hours of mission.  Plan to hold a.m. dose with planned open pelvic surgery tomorrow 3. Antibiotic Recommendations: We will plan for perioperative Ancef less than 24 hours.  May consider additional duration given traumatic bladder disruption if indwelling Foley are required.  4. N.p.o. past midnight.  Plan for exam under anesthesia, open reduction internal fixation of anterior pelvic ring as well as possible posterior fixation tomorrow in conjunction with open bladder repair    INCIDENTAL FINDING OF COVID POSITIVE ON  8/31/2021  PATIENT STILL HOSPITALIZED AT THE TIME OF REPORT","Contains critical data CORONAVIRUS (COVID 19) PCR - Asymptomatic, No Close Contact Exposure, or Screening Only Order: 277816126 Status:  Final result Specimen Information: NASOPHARYNGEAL SWAB    0 Result Notes  Ref Range & Units 8/31/21 0526 CORONAVIRUS SARS COV 2 PCR (RESP)  POSITIVE    Panic"
