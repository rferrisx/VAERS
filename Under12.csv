I could not find guidance in the FDA EUA document, but the CDC interim clinical considerations guidance does address (last updated 11/19/21) and now seems to recommend more clearly to repeat the dose immediately for lower than authorized dose administered e.g. leaked out:  Lower-than-authorized dose volume administered of the correct formulation (e.g., leaked out, equipment failure, recipient pulled away): Repeat dose immediately (no minimum interval). See: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html. Based on this, spoke to family, reviewed the limited data available from the phase 1 portion of the Pfizer trial, both 10 and 20 mcg doses were overall well tolerated, though high fever did develop in one child after dose 2 of the 20 mcg dose, lasting 3 days. Since this patient has both an underlying urea cycle defect and periodic fever syndrome, risk of fever bears consideration due to a higher predisposition as well as potential risk of metabolic sequelae arising from fever- so the discussion mostly focused around this increased risk of fever/ reactogenicity. Parents had a chance to talk to his geneticist and discuss amongst themselves, weighed risks vs benefits, felt they could likely manage a fever if it developed by working closely with his genetics team and they ultimately desired to ensure optimal protection by vaccination. He returned to the clinic, and was re-dosed without event. We have not had any other reports of this. The nurse is a seasoned vaccinator so I would trust her vaccination method.

I went into the medication room to mix a vial of the COVID vaccine with normal saline as I had been taught to do earlier in the day with Pharmacist. I opened the red bag of supplies to mix up the vaccine and only found one vial in the bag with a salmon colored top. Remembering that that the vaccine came in a vial with an orange top I believed this to be the vaccine and was looking for the diluent. Unable to locate some I called pharmacist and she informed me that I was fine to use normal saline from another source to mix the vaccine. I located another source of normal saline within the clinic and used it to mix 1.3ml of normal saline into the vial. After following the mixing instructions of inverting the initial vial 10x, added the diluent, removed 1.3ml of air, and then inverted the vial 10x to mix, I then drew up multiple syringes of 0.2ml RN and MA each took two syringes to vaccinators who were waiting to administer the vaccine to patients. approximately 10-15 minutes later another HCP and I called pharmacist to ensure I knew how to properly dispose of the unused vaccine. It was during this conversation that I realized I had not used the COVID vaccine vial but had used the diluent vial and had mixed additional NACL into the diluent vial. I immediately asked who had received the last 4 doses, 3 of those patients were still in the building and 1 patient had left. I notified the parents of the 3 patients who were still on the premises of the error that was made and apologized. I then asked if they would still like the patient to receive the COVID vaccine tonight and the parents agreed. Those 3 patients each received a dose after I went back into the med room and correctly mixed the vaccine. The patients remained under observation for 15 minutes and were then discharged.

It is if there is massive insulin resistance -- that we giver her insulin to cover meals but the insulin does not act how it normally does (we switched pods and insulin bottles to ensure it was not an equipment issue). She is 10 and has some puberty hormonal bg swings but we have not seen anything like this. The insulin, though supposed to start to take effect in 15 minutes is taking many hours. By then we have over corrected and then she crashes low.

The week before in comparison was 150bg, 65% in rance, 1% very high and 42SD. These numbers do not show the immense fear and exhaustion that this has caused.

I brought my 7 year old to the local pharmacy today at 1 pm. The nurse who administered the vaccine wasn't wearing a mask or gloves. She put on one glove when she actually injected my daughter, but wasn't wearing any when handling the vial or the syringe.   When she found out my daughter's age, she unnecessarily commented, """"oh she's so young."""" After my daughter received the vaccine, and we were waiting, I overheard the pharmacist and nurse disagreeing about the amount of vaccine that had been given to my daughter, and the other children that day. The pharmacist felt the nurse hadn't given enough in the syringe, neither was going to tell me, but luckily I overheard them and confronted them.  The pharmacist felt the nurse had used too much saline (1.85 ml) to dilute the vaccine, and as a result the nurse should have given a larger amount. The nurse disagreed, and they told me they were waiting for a """"higher up"""" at the pharmacy to weigh in.  The nurse said many times that I should not worry about the amount, and just to watch my daughter for side effects.  I now feel that she purposely administered a lower dose. I'm not sure if my daughter received a correct dose, and am quite frustrated that this has happened.   I want to report this so that someone can help me determine if she received a correct dose, and what our next steps should be. And also, to have someone look into the nurse and the incident, so that this doesn't happen to any other children and families.   I have reported this to the pharmacy, and am awaiting a response from the District Manager.
